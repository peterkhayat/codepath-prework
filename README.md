# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: Peter Khayat

Time spent: **15** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [x] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [x] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [x] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [x] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [x] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [x] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [x] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [x] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [x] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [x] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [x] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [x] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [x] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [x] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [x] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [Add a slider that decides how many buttons are on the website.
Also, a function so that the pitch of my sounds can be changed every time the sequence is changed.] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[To help complete my submission, I used every resource that was on the pre-work page. This includes all the instructions that were outlined on the webpage along with the links that were made available.
This was my first time working with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, so I really took my time familiarizing myself with these coding languages and interphases. 
Additionally, I used the following websites:
The first was used to made a picture appear when a button is pressed.

Whereas I used the second website to reset my audio every time.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[The first challenge I had to overcome was learning JavaScript, CSS and HTML. Although they are  new and unlike other languages I know, it was really fun and exciting getting to learn these languages. I always wanted to learn these languages but never had the guidance. This project was perfect in getting me to start learning about web development.
The required part of the pre-work was easy to code because of how well we were guided.
The optional part was challenging because it tested my understanding of both the code and everything we were taught. I had some problems figuring out how to add a timer, a picture and some sounds. I overcame this problem by going over the given website and revisiting the code to know how it works in details. I had to use visibility=visible and visibility=invisible which I had to find by myself. The audio was challenging because I couldn’t figure out how to reset my audio at every use. And finally, the timer because I didn’t know where to implement the function and to add a timer on the webpage.
 In short, although these problems were challenging due to their novelty, I enjoyed taking the initiative and independently finding solutions to acquire the skills I needed to complete the project, which required self-discipline and patience. Being able to navigate different resources and synthesizing all the knowledge I gathered is a valuable skill in it of itself, and this assignment challenged my abilities to do so.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I wonder how can I take a simple website like the one I did and make it more user friendly.  My project works as intended but I can think of many improvements regarding both functional and visual improvements. For instance, being able to add in interactive features to engage the user, or understanding concepts of aesthetics in the realm of web design to attract and appeal to the people visiting my website are fields of knowledge I am interested in.
In addition, everything I work on is considered front-end and I wonder what the backend looks like and how it is connected to the front-end.

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I took as much time as I needed to implement all of the required and optional function. I would have liked to add some more features but I was limited by the knowledge I have in those languages. For example, I would have liked to add a slider that decides how many buttons are on the website. Also, a function so that the pitch of my sounds can be changed every time the sequence is changed.]
